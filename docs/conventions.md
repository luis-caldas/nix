## Data Organising Convention

All data if not at home directory should be stored at `/data`

`/data/{drive name}/{partition name}/{first distinction}/{second distinction}/{specifics}`

Drive name would not be needed if there is only one drive, example of drive names are `local`, `store`, `bunker`

Partition name would not be needed if only a single partition from a single drive is used, the name of the folder should reflect the partition name

The first distinction should be named specifically as what it is, for example `container`, `storage`

Second distinction only needed if deemed necessary, it should then be named as what the distinction is about like if a subdivision in an application

Specifics of certain distinction should all be together and not scattered across other folders, sometimes specifications may also not be needed, certain specifics can be `env`, `safe`, `config`
